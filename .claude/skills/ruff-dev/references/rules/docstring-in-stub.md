Fix is always available.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for the presence of docstrings in stub files.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Stub files should omit docstrings, as they're intended to provide type
hints, rather than documentation.

## [Example](#example)

```
def func(param: int) -> str:
    """This is a docstring."""
    ...
```

Use instead:

```
def func(param: int) -> str: ...
```
